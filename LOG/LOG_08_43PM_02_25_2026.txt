════════ Exception caught by Flutter framework ═════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during runApp:
Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:
#0      BindingBase.debugCheckZone.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/foundation/binding.dart:519:31)
#1      BindingBase.debugCheckZone (package:flutter/src/foundation/binding.dart:525:6)
